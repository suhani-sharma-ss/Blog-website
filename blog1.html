Scientifically, this connection is supported by research demonstrating how our thoughts and emotions can influence physiological responses. Stress, for example, is not solely a mental experience; it can manifest physically, contributing to a range of health issues such as cardiovascular problems, weakened immune function, and digestive disorders.</p> <br>
